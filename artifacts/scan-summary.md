# Step 0 — Full Repo Scan Summary (finish/aura-prod-ready)

Generated: 2025-10-30

## File index
- Total files: 15,866
- Large files (>1MB): many under `frontend/node_modules` and one large binary `backend/server.exe` (~70 MB). Consider removing binaries from source control and adding to `.gitignore`.

## Tests
- Backend: `go test ./... -coverprofile=coverage.out`
  - Result: partial OK; low coverage
    - api: ~4.1%
    - rel: ~15.6%
  - Coverage written to `backend/coverage.out`

- Frontend:
  - Vitest: PASS (8 tests, 3 files) — browser mode, centralized fetch mock
  - Playwright: FAIL — preview webServer failed to start
    - Error: `ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED: @sveltejs/kit './internal'`
    - Action later: pin SvelteKit/adapter versions or adjust Playwright webServer to use `vite dev` instead of preview

## Linters
- golangci-lint: not installed (skipped). To run in CI, add setup step or dockerized linter.
- gosec: not installed (skipped). Add to CI with `securego/gosec` action.
- ESLint: FAIL with 52 errors, 87 warnings (types and unused vars across multiple Svelte/TS files).

## Dev stack (docker-compose.dev)
- Build: FAIL at frontend runner `COPY --from=builder /app/build ./build` (not found)
  - Likely due to adapter/build output mismatch. Needs Dockerfile adjustment to SvelteKit output directories.
- Backend health: FAILED (no service up)

## Immediate follow-ups (for Phase 1)
- Fix Playwright server bootstrap (use vite dev webServer; pin Kit and adapter).
- Adjust frontend Dockerfile to correct build output path.
- Add CI jobs for golangci-lint, gosec, ESLint, Vitest and Playwright.
- Remove binary artifacts from repo; add to .gitignore.
- Increase backend test coverage (especially policy/verify paths) and add integration test shims.
